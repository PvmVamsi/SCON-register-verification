# SCON-register-verification

The “SCON (Serial Control) register” in the 8051 microcontroller is an 8-bit register used to configure and control the serial communication functionality via the UART. It allows selection of different serial modes (Mode 0 to Mode 3) and manages essential features like enabling reception, handling 9-bit data communication, and controlling interrupts for transmission and reception. The register also includes flags for the transmission complete (“TI”) and reception complete (“RI”) interrupts, ensuring smooth serial data transfer operations.
